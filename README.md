# Portfolio

## Description
My portfolio website for showcasing projects I have previously created.

Links at the top of the header link to different sections of the page for convenience and
one link takes you to my resume on another site.

Portfolio "work" images are clickable to link you directly to the deployed URL of the
applications.

Portfolio website is mobile responsive as well.
